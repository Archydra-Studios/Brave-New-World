# Brave New World

Dawn breaks anew! March through parched sands with the sun scorching your back, thread through white-clad thundras as your blood freezes, take one last breath as wounds and gashes drain your lifeforce away. Will you conquer this brash, brutal nature... or will it conquer you?

Shall you propser in this brave new world, clad with new, unforgiving mechanics? Or will you fall victim to weather, plant, and and clumsiness.
